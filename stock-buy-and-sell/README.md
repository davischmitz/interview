## Stocks Buy And Sell - Maximize Profit

Given an array of stock prices, find the maximum profit with a single buy and sell operation.

The values in the array represent the cost of stock each day. We can buy and sell the stock only once.

The function should return the maximum profit that can be achieved.

If no profit can be achieved, the function should return 0.
